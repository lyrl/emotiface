### App Flow/Pseudo Code:

1. Display opening landing page with instructions and start button
2. Player clicks start button
3. Live webcam video is turned on
6. Player makes a face conveying an extreme emotion
7. If face is found (from facial recognition detection) -> then display the score of each emotion, as returned from AI, in a pop up modal window
8. If face is NOT found (from facial recognition detection) -> then alert user the face was not found, and refresh the screen to allow user to try again

<a name="userstories">

### User Stories:

Target User Demographic = young people with Autism or Asperger's who want to practice reading facial expressions and have fun  figuring out emotions and learning how their facial expressions might be perceived by others. 

1. As a user, I want to play a game with bright fun colors and simple, easy to understand button prompts.
2. As a user, I want to take a photo of a face and see what emotions are found from that face.
3. As a user, I want to play simply for my own personal enjoyment and edification. I don't want scores or competition.
4. As a user, I want to see emoticons for each emotion checked so I can understand why that emotion was found, from the picture I took.
5. As a user, I want to know if no face was found in the picture and be able to quickly and easily take another picture.
